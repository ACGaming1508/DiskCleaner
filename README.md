# DiskCLeaner
Clean all unnecessary/temporary files in your local disk.

## How to use
1. Open the [batch file](https://github.com/ACGaming1508/DiskCLeaner/blob/main/DiskCleaner.bat), copy all content of it.
2. Create a new Text Document(.txt), paste the scripts into it and save the file (You can set the file's name to anything you'd like.).
3. Run the file created as Administrator (Some commands won't work without administrator's permissions).

## Note
- Batch file only works on Windows.
- Do not delete or modify anything if you don't know what it is.
- The file just clears almost all unncessary/temporary files in your disk, not attempt to destroy/attack your PC.
